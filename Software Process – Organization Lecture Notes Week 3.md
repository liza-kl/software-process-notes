## Slides â€“ Agility
- ==What is **Agility**?==
	- Being able to make changes and do what is needed to be successful 
	- This includes the ability to determine how changes impact your organisation, features and technical choices. The ability to gather the **right people** for the changes and the ability to replan work
	- 
- ==How does **Scrum enables agility**?==
	- Planned user stories can be adapted each sprint
	- Celebrate learning, failing, negative feedback in retrospectives
- ==Why is it so hard to **organize feedback**?== ^f53f9d
	- We need feedback 
## Slides â€“ History of organizational science
- ===*What is an **Organization**?*===
	- Organizations are social entities that are goal-oriented; are designed as deliberately structured and coordinated activity  systems, and are linked to the external environment
- ===*What are **goals of software organizations**?*===
	- Help create **business value**
		- By delivering **software that is needed when it is needed**
		- With the **resources available**
		- With **good enough quality**
		- With **enough predictability to coordindate other organisational activities**
		- That will not jeopardise the continuity of the organisation (commit to many of the resources to maintenance, will be evolvable)
		- Making **efficient use of the resources**
- *===What is the **essence of organisational goals**?===*
	1. Get the job done
	2. Efficiency
	3. Fairness
	4. Continuity 
- *===What is the **scientific management method** from Taylor*?=== ^414012
	- There is *one right way* to do it and you can measure everything
- ==*What are assumptions of scientific management?==*
	1. The primary goal of labor and thought is efficiency.
	2. Technical calculation in all respects is superior to human judgment.
	3. Human judgment cannot be trusted because it is plagued by laxity, ambiguity, and unnecessary complexity.
	4. Subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking.
	5. What cannot be measured either does not exist or is of no value.
	6. The affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts.
- *===What are the four principles of **scientific management**===?*
	1. **Choose methods based on science:**Â Use the scientific method to determine the most efficient way to complete a task.Â Focus on increasing productivity and profits.
	2. **Assign workers to tasks based on their natural skillset:**Â Get to know your workers, discover what theyâ€™re good at, and place them where their skills will be the most useful.
	3. **Monitor your workersâ€™ performance:**Â Observe what your workers are doing while they are on the clock so that you can quickly address any problems. If some workers are confused or unproductive, it is up to their managers to step in and fix the issue.
	4. **Divide workloads appropriately between workers and managers:**Â Make sure that managers understand how to plan and train workers and that workers understand how to implement those plans
- *===ðŸ”¥ How does **bureaucracy ensure fairness and predictability**?==* ^979a74
	- **Hierarchy** â€“ The spheres of competence and divisions of labor are clearly defined
	- **Continuity** â€“ A structure where administrators have a full-time salary and advance within the structure 
	- **Impersonality** â€“ Prescribes rules and operating rules rather than arbitrary actions 
	- **Expertise** â€“ Officials are chosen according to merit, have been trained and hold access to knowledge
	- *bureaucracy can promote diversity within government organizations and, more broadly, social equity throughout the nation*
	- Protects people from *arbitrary decisions* inside the organization
	- Provides scope for decision making and boundaries 
- ===*Why is **bureaucracy negatively annotated**?*===
	- Slow, more regulations, lots of rules to achieve clarity 
- *===What are the **five management functions** according to Fayol?===*
	- Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, Controlling
- ===What is the **Hawthorne Effect**?===
	- People are performing better, when being evaluated (Increasing light on them in the original experiment increased the productivity and vice versa)
- ===What can we learn from the military in terms of planning and empowerment?===
	- Actions have more to do with what we are used to do, then with what the situation requires
	- Let decisions be made by those that have best understanding of  situation

## Questions at end of slides
- ==Why would too much planning make a project less agile?==
- ==Which planning mistakes would make it hard for the project to be successful?==
- ==Why would too little planning make a project less agile?==
	- *Before you can have a plan, you need at least **a** plan*
	- Being agile is about shifting the focus to doing the most important work first and in a consistent quality standard
	- Not having boundaries reduces the clariy 
## Miscellaneous

- What shoul determine the complexity of testability?
	- There is a relationship
	- Document Design
	- Behavior Documentation
	- If the feedback loop is slow, longtestability
- What are potential trade offs to make in testability?
	- Does the customer wants fast delivieres or mmore qualitative feedback?
- ==*ðŸ”¥ What to do to improve the productivity?==*
	- Look at the types of tasks in Jira, Look at them timewise (which are the top tickets in speed development).
	- "Your system is as good as your top X"
